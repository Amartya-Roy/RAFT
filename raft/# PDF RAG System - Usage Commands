2. **Use keywords**: Include important terms from the document
3. **Ask one thing at a time**: Break complex questions into simpler ones
4. **Check context**: Use "Show context? y" to see what text was used for the answer

```bash
# Make sure the file exists and path is correct
ls -la /path/to/your/document.pdf

### If you get import errors:
```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
pip install --upgrade sentence-transformers PyPDF2 torch transformers
```

### If the PDF text extraction fails:
- Make sure it's a text-based PDF (not scanned images)
- Try a different PDF file
- Check if the PDF is password protected
